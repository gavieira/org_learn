To succesfully create pdfs with citations from org-export-dispatch, you have to change the variable `org-latex-pdf-process` to use latexmk instead of latex, as described in  [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref/issues/346][_this link_]].

In *doom emacs*, you can change this variable in ~/.doom.d/config.el

Citing again. \cite{Vieira2019,Valdez-Velazquez2020,Zhang2014}


You can use any bibliography style that you like. Some are available [[https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/bibtex_bibliography_styles}][here]]. I particularly use the apalike style.
